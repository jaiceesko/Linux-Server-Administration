#### SHARING AND TRANSFERRING FILES IN LINUX

# A file server is one which can give your users a central place to store critical files.

# With Ubuntu server, there are methods to transfer files from one node to another over a network.

# Setting up a central file server using both Samba and NFS.

# Transfer files between nodes with utilities such as scp and rsysnc.


## File Server considerations



## Sharing files with Windows users via Samba

# create samba file share filesystem

sudo mkdir -p /share/Documents

sudo mkdir /share/Public

# Install samba package

sudo apt update

sudo apt install samba

# check if installation was successful
whereis samba

# When you install the samba package, you will have smbd daemon started and enabled automatically.

# stop the smbd daemon before configuration

sudo systemctl stop smbd

# Backup the /etc/samba/smb.conf configuration file

sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak

# We going to split the samba configuration up between two files for cleaner and easier to read:

# /etc/samba/smb.conf and /etc/samba/smbshared.conf

# sample of edited /etc/samba/smb.conf file

[global]
server string = File Server
workground = WORKGROUND
security = user
map to guest = Bad User
name resolve order = host bcast wins
include = /etc/samba/smbshared.conf


# sample of edited /etc/samba/smbshared.conf file

[Documents]
path = /share/Documents
force user = myuser
force group = users
public = yes
writable = no

[Public]
path = /share/Public
force user = myuser
force group = users
create mask = 0664
force create mode = 0664
directory mask = 0777
force directory mode = 0777
public = yes
writable = yes

# change /share directory ownership

sudo chown -R server2:server2 /share

# start and enable the smbd daemon

sudo systemctl enable smbd

sudo systemctl start smbd

systemctl status smbd

## Mount windows share on linux via cifs-utils

sudo apt install cifs-utils -y

# create a directory to mount windows share

sudo mkdir /mnt/documents

sudo mount -t cifs //server2/share/Documents -o username=myuser /mnt/documents
