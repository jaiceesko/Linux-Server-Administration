### STORAGE DEVICES IN LINUX

## ADDING A BASIC DISK TO LINUX

# First run lsblk command to list the system's disks and identify the new drive

sudo lsblk
# for a usb device inserted, use lsusb command
sudo lsusb
# You can list model and serial numbers 
sudo lsblk -o <model | serial>

## PARTIONING HARD DISKS

# VIEWING DISK PARTITIONS

# To view disk partitions, use parted command with -l option

sudo parted -l /dev/sda

sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb

# Unmounting the existing disk first before starting partition

sudo parted -l /dev/sdb

sudo umount /media/ubuntu2024/SSS_X64FREE_EN-US_DV9

sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

# select d for deletion
# select the partition number to delete
# Confirm partition deletion by type p
# save changes and quit

## CREATING A SINGLE-PARTITION DISKO

# We want to install partition table on the disk /dev/sdb

# we can use choose one of this commands parted, gparted, fdisk command
# Determine the device name for the USB drive.
sudo lsusb
sudo lsblk
sudo journalctl -f

# If the usb flash drive mounts automatically, unmount it.
sudo mount | grep sdb

sudo umount /dev/sdb1

sudo parted /dev/sdb

# Label or Relabel the disk as having gpt partition table
mklabel gpt
# Create a new partition
mkpart
# name partition
alldisk

# select start and end
1 to 62.0GB
# double check the drive is partitioned press
p
# partion is /dev/sdb1

# We can now create a filesystem on /dev/sdb1 with mkfs command. the -L option
# gives the filesystem a shorthand label.

sudo mkfs -t xfs -L first_test /dev/sdb1

# Next, create a mount point and mount the new filesystem

sudo mkdir /mnt/test
sudo mount LABEL=first_test /mnt/test

# Check that the mount succeeded.
sudo mount
sudo mount | grep sdb
sudo lsblk
sudo df -h /mnt/test


# To have the filesystem automatically mounted at boot time.
# Edit the /etc/fstab file

LABEL=spare	/mnt/test	xfs	error=remote-ro		0  0

# Unmounting the drive with umount command
sudo umount /dev/sdb1
