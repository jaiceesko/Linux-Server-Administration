### USING LOGICAL VOLUME MANAGER PARTITIONS

## With LVM, physical disk partitions are added to pools of space called Volume groups.

### LVM abilities:
# Add more space to a logical volume from the volume group while the volume is still in use.
# Add more physical volumes to a volume group if the volume group begins to run out of space. The physical volumes can be from disks.
# Move data from one physical volume to another so you can remove smaller disks and replace them with larger ones
# While the filesystems are still in use again, without downtime.

## LVM also supports advanced features, such as mirroring and working in clusters, snapshots.

## Checking an Existing LVM
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda

# Use the pvdisplay command to see if that partition is being used in LVM group

sudo pvdisplay /dev/sda2

# You wan to see information about the volume group
sudo vgdisplay vg_sdb6

## Creating LVM Logical Volumes
# First create one or more physical volumes (pv).
## Create volume groups (vg) from physical volumes.
## Third, create logical volumes from the volume groups (lv).

# Create a new physical volume
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1
# Add a physical volume to a new group, use vgcreate command.
sudo vgcreate vg_lvm /dev/sdb6

# To see the new volume group
sudo vgdisplay vg_lvm

# To create a logical volume from some of the space in that volume group

sudo lvcreate -n lvm_home -L 2G vg_lvm

# Check the logical volume exists

sudo ls -la /dev/mapper/vg_lvm*

# Create a filesystem
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mapper/vg_lvm-lvm_home

# Make a directory
sudo mkdir /mnt/home-lvm_home

# Mounting the device
sudo mount /dev/mapper/vg_lvm-lvm_home /mnt/home-lvm_home

# Confirm the device being mounted.

sudo df -h /mnt/home-lvm_home

# Logical volumes can be mounted permanently by adding an entry to the /etc/fstab file
/dev/mapper/vg_lvm-lvm_home  /mnt/home-lvm_home  ext4  defaults 1 2


### Growing LVM Logical Volumes

# If you run out of space on a logical volume, you can add space to it without even unmounting it.
#You must have space available in the volume group, grow the logical volume, and grow the filesystem to fill it.

sudo vgdisplay vg_lvm

df -h /mnt/home-lvm_home

# Expand the logical volume using the lvextend command:
sudo lvextend -L +10G /dev/mapper/vg_lvm-lvm_home

# Resize the filesystem to fit the new logical volume size:
sudo resize2fs -p /dev/mapper/vg_lvm-lvm_home

# Check to see that the filesystem is now resized to include the additional disk space:
sudo df -h /mnt/home-lvm_home/
